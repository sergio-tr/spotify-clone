# Spotify Clone

Welcome to the **Spotify Clone** repository! This project is a personal exercise aimed at practicing and improving my skills with various web technologies. The goal is to recreate a simplified version of Spotify, focusing on building a functional and visually appealing interface.

## Project Overview

This project involves cloning the core features of Spotify using the following technologies:
- **React**: For building the user interface and handling application state.
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.
- **Svelte**: For creating interactive components and experimenting with reactive programming.
- **Astro**: For integrating the different parts of the application and optimizing the build process.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Display featured playlists, albums.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for songs, albums, and artists.
- **Playback Controls**: Implement basic playback controls (play, pause, next, previous).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: To build the main user interface and manage application state.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and customizable styling.
  - **Svelte**: For creating reusable and reactive components.
  - **Astro**: To manage the integration of React and Svelte components and optimize the final build.

## Getting Started
